http is a protocol on how data is sent to or taken from the  server

a url is made up of several parts (protocolo, port, resource, query string) and it is the way for your computer to find and access the web page that you are looking for

dns takes your hostname that you enter in the browser and translates it into a ip address for your device

a query string is extra information on a page that is added to the end of a url in a get request

get - get data from the server (no changes in server)
post - send data to server (changes data in server)

a request is a request from a client to a sever following http protocols

a response is how the sever responds to the request (response code etc..)

headers are information about the request or response for example langauge, time, cookies etc..

when you enter a url the hostname is translated into an ip address where a request is sent and then the server returns a page dynamically with a response getting all aditional links from seperate requests
